This is a repo for the custom Arduino board "Small Mesh Sensor Board" based on the ATMEGA2560 chip.

## Installation

To install (as of Arduion IDE 1.8.13):
1. Go to ``File`` > ``Preferences``
2. In ``Additional Board Manager URLs``, add [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueNalgene/ArduinoCore-SmallMesh2560/master/package_SmallMesh2560_index.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlueNalgene/ArduinoCore-SmallMesh2560/master/package_SmallMesh2560_index.json)
3. Click ``OK``
4. Go to ``Tools`` > ``Board:`` > ``Board Manager...``
5. (optional) Sort by Type: Contributed to see a smaller list of boards
6. Find ``SmallMesh2560`` in the scroll list and click ``Install``

## Hardware

The custom hardware which uses these board definitions is described in detail in my dissertation:
[Development and applications of chemical sensors for the detection of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane](https://shareok.org/handle/11244/54540).  This is an open-source repo of the dissertation
which includes complete schematics for the board in question.

## Credits

Original board definitions by Nicholas F. Materer.  Updated and maintained by Wesley T. Honeycutt.
